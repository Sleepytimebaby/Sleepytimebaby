- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sleepytimebaby
- 👀 I’m interested in neurobiology, machine-learning, and applying biological concepts to artificial intelligenc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Santiago Ramon y Cajal discvored, using Golgi's staining method, that neurons don't touch. Instead they communicate across tiny gaps; synapses. this crucial insight laid the groundwork for how toughts, memories , and movements
are transmitted in the brain. 

- My project's are still in research and development, so any of my findings are not yet available for open source applications. However, I am happy to provide insights and assistance for other projects. You can reach me on discord @sleepytimebaby. 
I love discussing ideas, and I'm happy to provide volunteer work in order to build my portfolio.
